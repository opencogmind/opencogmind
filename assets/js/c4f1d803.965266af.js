Different levels of AI capability can bring different types of risks. As AI progresses from basic to more sophisticated stages (like from "Emerging AGI" to "Expert AGI" and ultimately to "ASI" - Advanced Superintelligence), new risks arise. For example, at the "Expert AGI" stage, there might be risks related to job losses and economic changes. In contrast, at higher levels like "Virtuoso AGI" and "ASI," there are concerns about existential risks, such as an AI deceiving humans to achieve its goals.
