Different levels of AI capability can bring different types of risks. As AI progresses from basic to more sophisticated stages (like from "Emerging AGI" to "Expert AGI" and ultimately to "ASI" - Advanced Superintelligence), new risks arise. For example, at the "Expert AGI" stage, there might be risks related to job losses and economic changes. In contrast, at higher levels like "Virtuoso AGI" and "ASI," there are concerns about existential risks, such as an AI deceiving humans to achieve its goals. The more "x-systemic risks," like destabilizing international relations, significantly if AI development outpaces regulation, need deeper collaboration and understanding by the policymakers within various countries focusing on immediate and long-term risks.'),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"With varying capability levels brings risks associated, The risks are summarized at various levels of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) below:"),(0,r.kt)("h4",{id:"risk-introduction-with-advanced-agi"},"Risk Introduction with Advanced AGI:"),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"As AI progresses towards Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), new risks arise.
