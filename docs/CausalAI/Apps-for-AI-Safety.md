# Apps for AI Safety

"Welcome back! Which Apps are most influential for ensuring AI Safety, a cornerstone of the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence. In this post, weâ€™ll unravel the pivotal roles played by three groundbreaking AI applications: 
-*Anomaly Detection*, 
-*Forecasting*, and 
-*Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) Techniques*.

Imagine AI as the pilot of a spaceship; it needs the best navigation tools to safely traverse the cosmos. Anomaly Detection acts as the ship's radar, constantly scanning for space debris or unexpected asteroids, ensuring a clear path ahead. Forecasting is like the ship's advanced navigation system, predicting cosmic weather and charting a course for smooth sailing. Meanwhile, RLHF Techniques serve as the essential communication link between the AI and its human crew, guiding it with wisdom and experience to make decisions that ensure the safety and well-being of all on board.
Join me as we explore how these technologies work in tandem to create a safety net for AI systems, safeguarding us from potential risks and steering us towards an era of innovation where safety and progress go hand in hand. Don't forget to hit that like button, subscribe, and buckle up for a journey into the future of AI Safety. Let's get started!"

### Need for Reusable and Modular Framework for AI Safety

As a generic modular framework for AI Safety, the modules within the framework must support the following  three aspects: 
-*Observability*
-*Monitoring*
-*Continuous feedback and improvement*

A workflow describing various functionalities necessary for various Apps for observing and monitoring AI risks include:

##### Data Ingestion
-*Source Data*: Collect data from various sources relevant to the domain of application.
-*Performance Indicators*: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) that define normal operations.
-*Event Logging*: Log events that could signify operational issues or performance deviations.

##### Transport / ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
-*Data Transportation*: Move data from its origin to a centralized system for processing.
-*Data Transformation*: Convert data into a uniform format suitable for analysis.
-*Continuous Monitoring*: Implement real-time monitoring to detect operational anomalies as they occur.

##### Anomaly Detection
-*Pattern Identification*: Use algorithms to identify patterns and deviations from the norm.
-*Anomaly Scoring*: Assign scores to detected anomalies based on severity or impact.
-*Anomaly Prioritization*: Prioritize anomalies to address the most critical ones first.
-*Anomaly Classification*: Categorize anomalies for appropriate response strategies.

##### Anomaly Correlation & Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
-*Impact Analysis*: Determine the potential impact of anomalies on customer experience and service quality.
-*Root Cause Interpreter*: Utilize machine learning models to classify and correlate anomalies to their potential root causes.
-*Advanced Root Cause Interpreter*: Integrate more sophisticated models for in-depth analysis and instance identification.

##### Business Process Integration
-*Event Association*: Correlate anomalies with business processes to understand the broader impact.
-*Closing the Loop*: Ensure that the system learns from anomalies to improve processes and prevent future occurrences.
-*Forecasting*: Use historical data to predict and prepare for potential future anomalies.

By following this generic framework, organizations across various sectors can implement an effective anomaly detection system tailored to their specific needs. This ensures the reliability and safety of their operations, by proactively identifying and addressing anomalies.
