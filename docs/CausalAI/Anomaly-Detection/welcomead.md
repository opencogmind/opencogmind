# Anomaly Detection & AI Safety
"Hello everyone, welcome back to [OpenCogmind](https://opencogmind.com/)! I'm [Raghav Chalapathy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghav-chalapathy-phd-80984117/), and today we're going to delve into a crucial aspect of AI technology that's vital for ensuring its safe application: Anomaly Detection for AI Safety.

### Context!
As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various aspects of our daily lives, from self-driving cars to healthcare systems, ensuring its safety is not just a priority; it's an absolute necessity. This is where Anomaly Detection comes into play, serving as a guardian in the world of AI.

### What is Anomaly Detection?

Anomaly Detection in AI is essentially like having a highly skilled detective within the system. It continuously monitors AI behavior, looking for any deviations from normal patterns that could indicate potential problems. These could be glitches, unexpected responses, or any kind of irregularities that, if left unchecked, could lead to errors, accidents, or even catastrophic failures.

### Why should we care about Anomaly Detection?
Now, you might wonder, why is Anomaly Detection so important? The answer is simple yet profound. As AI systems become more complex and autonomous, the chances of unforeseen errors increase. These errors, or anomalies, can range from minor inconveniences to major safety hazards, especially in critical applications like autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, or financial systems.

#### Real world scenarios's : Use Cases of Anomaly Detection
Imagine a scenario where an AI-powered monitoring system in a hospital fails to recognize a patient's deteriorating condition due to an anomaly in its data processing. Or consider the consequences if an autonomous vehicle's AI system misinterprets a road sign due to a glitch. Anomaly Detection acts as a safety net, catching these issues before they escalate.

The beauty of Anomaly Detection in AI Safety lies in its proactive approach. Instead of waiting for errors to occur and then responding, it actively seeks out potential problems, allowing for immediate corrective actions. This not only enhances the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems but also significantly reduces the risk of harm to humans.
