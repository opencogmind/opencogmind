### Synopsis
TEN ARGUMENTS FOR  WHY THERE IS EXISTENTIAL THREAT OF AI RIGHT NOW is currently a work in progress. This book explores the challenges and potential risks posed by advanced artificial intelligence, and how humanity can prepare and respond to these emerging concerns.

### Why This Book?
In the heart of this book lies a profound concern for the future of humanity—a future intricately intertwined with the burgeoning realm of artificial intelligence. This isn't merely a technological revolution; it's a pivotal moment that will redefine society, economics, and most importantly, the legacy we leave for our children. As I delve into the complexities of AI safety and existential risks, my motivation transcends academic interest. It's driven by a deep-seated realization that the decisions we make about AI today will sculpt the world of tomorrow. This technology, blossoming right beneath our noses, holds unprecedented power to transform every facet of our lives—from how we interact as a society to the very essence of our global economy. But it is in the eyes of our children, the inheritors of this AI-shaped world, that the true weight of our responsibility is felt. This book is born from a fervent desire to safeguard their future, to ensure that the AI we nurture is a force for good, harmonious with the values we cherish. It's a call to action for all of us, to engage with, understand, and guide this extraordinary force, so that the world our children inherit is one where AI stands as a beacon of progress, safety, and prosperity.

### About the Author
Hello readers, my name is [Raghav Chalapathy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghav-chalapathy-phd-80984117/)
A decade of research into detecting rare [events or anomalies](https://raghavchalapathy.github.io/KDD-Tutorials-2020-Deep-Robust-Anomaly-Detection/#about) sparked my curiosity in this field. This interest, combined with my experience in ensuring the safety of bridges in Australia, which earned me national recognition, and my success in a Global AI challenge where I won a [bronze medal](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6953778145170735105-joeF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) for accurately forecasting energy usage for a building in Malaysia, has led me to believe that it's my moral responsibility to contribute to society. I am now focused on educating the public about the critical importance of AI safety, a field that holds significant power in shaping the future of humanity.Thank you for joining me on this adventure, and I look forward to sharing my thoughts and experiences.
