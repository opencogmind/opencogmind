### Focus on Capabilities, Not Processes: 
>*AGI should be judged by what it can do, not how it does it. This means AGI doesn't need to think or understand like humans, nor does it need consciousness or feelings*.

### Focus on Generality and Performance: 
>*AGI should be both general (able to do many different tasks) and perform well in those tasks*.

### Focus on Cognitive and Metacognitive Tasks: 
>*AGI should be able to perform mental tasks and have self-awareness skills like learning new tasks or knowing when to ask for help. Physical tasks (like moving objects) are helpful but not necessary for AGI.*

### Focus on Potential, Not Deployment: 
>*Whether AGI can perform certain tasks is more important than actually using it in real-life scenarios*.

### Focus on Ecological Validity: 
>*The tasks used to measure AGI's progress should be meaningful and practical, reflecting real-world skills people value.*

### Focus on the Journey not the End Goal. 
>*AGI should be seen as a series of levels, each with specific abilities and benchmarks, rather than a single goal.*


Following the first principles levels capability levels can be identified and status can be tracked as shown in the figure below:

There are instances where AI has already reached super-human capabilities. An example is [AlphaFold](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/), considered a Level 5 Narrow AI ("Superhuman Narrow AI") because it predicts protein structures more accurately than top scientists. While the current [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [BARD](https://bard.google.com/?utm_source=sem&utm_medium=paid-media&utm_campaign=q4enUS_sem7&gclid=CjwKCAiAvJarBhA1EiwAGgZl0LAA1YZ6HTMrTZ3u7_sRtJqk-o6OdsDcYWxW9kPY4U6a9aATK-5a5RoCYmUQAvD_BwE) conversational AI's perform at competent level in essay and script writing, matching or sometimes better than human expert, but are still "Emerging" in most areas (like math or factuality). Thus, they are classified as Level 1 General AI ("Emerging AGI").
Hence it is most like that AI systems are rated based on how well they perform tasks compared to skilled adults. For example, a "Competent AGI" ([Artificial General Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02462.pdf)) should perform at or above the 50th percentile of adult humans in most cognitive tasks, but it might excel (Expert, Virtuoso, or even Superhuman levels) in specific areas.
Following the journey of AGI within specific domain expertise would be a fascinating concept to follow in the comming years.
