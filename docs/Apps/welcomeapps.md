# Applications influencing AI Safety

This section consists of welcome apps and in the section

Apps for enabling AI Safety

 Anomaly Detection 
 Forecasting 
 RLHF Techniques 

 The above methods help to ensure the safety of the AI systems deployed write and eloborate how based on this skeleton framework
 


### Reusable and Modular Framework for AI Safety


As a generic modular framework for AI Safety, the modules within the framework must support the following  three aspects: 
-*Observability*
-*Monitoring*
-*Continuous feedback and improvement*

A workflow describing various functionalities that must be supported for various Apps for observing and monitoring AI risks include:

##### Data Ingestion
Source Data: Collect data from various sources relevant to the domain of application.
Performance Indicators: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) that define normal operations.
Event Logging: Log events that could signify operational issues or performance deviations.

##### Transport / ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
Data Transportation: Move data from its origin to a centralized system for processing.
Data Transformation: Convert data into a uniform format suitable for analysis.
Continuous Monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring to detect operational anomalies as they occur.
Anomaly Detection
Pattern Identification: Use algorithms to identify patterns and deviations from the norm.
Anomaly Scoring: Assign scores to detected anomalies based on severity or impact.
Anomaly Prioritization: Prioritize anomalies to address the most critical ones first.
Anomaly Classification: Categorize anomalies for appropriate response strategies.
Anomaly Correlation & Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
Impact Analysis: Determine the potential impact of anomalies on customer experience and service quality.
Root Cause Interpreter: Utilize machine learning models to classify and correlate anomalies to their potential root causes.
Advanced Root Cause Interpreter: Integrate more sophisticated models for in-depth analysis and instance identification.
Business Process Integration
Event Association: Correlate anomalies with business processes to understand the broader impact.
Closing the Loop: Ensure that the system learns from anomalies to improve processes and prevent future occurrences.
Forecasting: Use historical data to predict and prepare for potential future anomalies.
By following this generic framework, organizations across various sectors can implement an effective anomaly detection system tailored to their specific needs. This ensures the reliability and safety of their operations, by proactively identifying and addressing anomalies.





Architecture for Apps introduce an image and discuss about it tell how people can reuse it in their projects at production 
in their own use cases
