# Shaping the Future of AI Safety: Few Technical Methods which may play pivotal role
Primary requirements Shaping the Future of AI Safety are :
- **[Aligning with Ethics and Values](https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics)**
- **[Building Trust](https://www.ibm.com/watson/advantage-reports/future-of-artificial-intelligence/building-trust-in-ai.html)**
- **[Preventing Harm](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/adding-structure-to-ai-harm/)**


### Aligning with [Ethics and Values](https://www.unesco.org/en/artificial-intelligence/recommendation-ethics)
In my view, **AI safety transcends mere technical robustness**; it embodies the principle of 
creating  responsible [AI systems](https://uit.stanford.edu/security/responsibleai) that harmoniously coexist with human values and societal norms.
This overarching theme is crucial as we delve deeper into AI's capabilities and ensure 

### [Building Trust](https://www.ibm.com/watson/advantage-reports/future-of-artificial-intelligence/building-trust-in-ai.html)
Applications capable of detecting counterfeits and misinformation are essential in fostering public trust in AI systems, 
a crucial factor for their widespread acceptance and integration into society.
####  Counterfeiting Detection
The advent of AI has brought about sophisticated techniques not only in creating but also in [detecting counterfeits](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-is-a-new-weapon-in-the-battle-against-counterfeits-11596805200).
 As an AI researcher, I emphasize the importance of AI systems that can **discern authenticity with high accuracy**, 
 a task crucial for maintaining trust in [digital transactions](https://stefanini.com/en/insights/news/artificial-intelligence-protect-luxury-brands-from-counterfeit) and intellectual property.
#### Misinformation and Fake News Detection
In the current information age, AI's role in discerning truth from falsehood is paramount. 
The development of algorithms capable of identifying misinformation is not just a technical challenge 
but a **societal imperative**, given the far-reaching consequences of fake news.
### [Prevention Harm](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/adding-structure-to-ai-harm/)
By accurately forecasting information The essence of AI safety lies in ensuring that AI systems behave [predictably](https://www.safe.ai/research) and beneficially, especially in [high-stakes scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15474). Accurate forecasting is the 
cornerstone of this endeavor, as they enable AI systems to anticipate potential risks and outcomes, 
thereby preventing harm and ensuring reliable operation.

Examples Illustrating the importance of accurate forecasting  for AI Safety and preventing catastrophe in society are :

- **Financial Markets**: AI systems are increasingly used in financial markets for predicting market trends and automating trading. Accurate predictions 
are essential to avoid erroneous trades that could lead to substantial financial losses or market instability. 

- **AI in Energy Grids**: AI systems are used to predict energy demand and supply in power grids. Accurate predictions ensure the stability of the grid by balancing supply and demand. 
A misprediction could lead to either energy wastage or a shortage, potentially causing blackouts.

- **Autonomous Vehicles**: In the realm of autonomous driving, the safety of passengers 
and pedestrians hinges on the vehicle's ability to make accurate predictions.
