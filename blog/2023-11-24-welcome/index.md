# Welcome to My Journal
Hello readers, my name is [Raghav Chalapathy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghav-chalapathy-phd-80984117/)
I am excited to share my journey with you through this journal. I have always been passionate about writing and have decided to take the leap and start my blog. This journal will serve as a platform to document my personal and professional growth, share my experiences and insights, and connect with like-minded individuals. While in my quiet moments, my thoughts often wander to the enigma of the human brain and its mysteries waiting to be unraveled.

## The Excitement of Digital Intelligence
I am particularly excited about the current developments in creating a non-biological brain with digital intelligence. Renowned scientists are raising concerns about the existential threats to humanity posed by this advancement and are emphasizing the importance of AI safety. 

### AI Safety: A Critical Topic
AI safety is the most critical topic of our times because, akin to [Oppenheimer's moment](https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/07/18/christopher-nolan-warns-that-ai-is-reaching-its-oppenheimer-moment#:~:text=Christopher%20Nolan%20warns%20that%20AI%20is%20reaching%20its%20'Oppenheimer%20moment',-Director%20Christopher%20Nolan&text=%22We%20have%20to%20hold%20people,atomic%20bomb%20could%20doom%20humanity) of realization about the profound impact of nuclear technology, we stand at a pivotal juncture where the responsible development and management of AI could evolve into Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) eventually to [Artificial Super Intelligence](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bLvc7XkSSnoqSukgy/a-brief-collection-of-hinton-s-recent-comments-on-agi-risk) which has the potential to determine the trajectory of humanity's future.

#### My Journey in relation to AI Safety
Anomaly detection and forecasting in AI safety serve as the digital equivalent of a canary in a coal mine, providing an essential early warning system that guards against the unforeseen and potentially dangerous paths of AI, ensuring its alignment with the safe and beneficial course charted for a safe.
A decade of research into detecting rare [events or anomalies](https://raghavchalapathy.github.io/KDD-Tutorials-2020-Deep-Robust-Anomaly-Detection/#about) sparked my curiosity in this field. This interest, combined with my experience in ensuring the safety of bridges in Australia, which earned me national recognition, and my success in a Global AI challenge where I won a [bronze medal](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6953778145170735105-joeF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) for accurately forecasting energy usage for a building in Malaysia, has led me to believe that it's my moral responsibility to contribute to society. I am now focused on educating the public about the critical importance of AI safety, a field that holds significant power in shaping the future of humanity.

Thank you for joining me on this adventure, and I look forward to sharing my thoughts and experiences.
