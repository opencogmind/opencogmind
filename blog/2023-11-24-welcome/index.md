# Welcome to My Journal
Hello readers, my name is [Raghav Chalapathy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghav-chalapathy-phd-80984117/)
I am excited to share my journey with you through this journal. I have always been passionate about writing and have decided to take the leap and start my blog. This journal will serve as a platform to document my personal and professional growth, share my experiences and insights, and connect with like-minded individuals. While in my quiet moments, my thoughts often wander to the enigma of the human brain and its mysteries waiting to be unraveled.

## The Excitement of Non-Biological Brains
I am particularly excited about the current developments in creating a non-biological brain. Renowned scientists are raising concerns about the existential threats to humanity posed by this advancement and are emphasizing the importance of AI safety. 

### AI Safety: A Critical Topic
AI safety is the most critical topic of our times because, akin to Oppenheimer's moment of realization about the profound impact of nuclear technology, we stand at a pivotal juncture where the responsible development and management of AI could evolve into Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) eventually to ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) which will determine the trajectory of humanity's future.

#### My Journey in relation to AI Safety
Anomaly detection and forecasting in AI safety serve as the digital equivalent of a canary in a coal mine, providing an essential early warning system that guards against the unforeseen and potentially dangerous paths of AI, ensuring its alignment with the safe and beneficial course charted for a safe.
A decade of research into detecting rare [events or anomalies](https://raghavchalapathy.github.io/KDD-Tutorials-2020-Deep-Robust-Anomaly-Detection/#about) sparked my curiosity in this field. This interest, combined with my experience in ensuring the safety of bridges in Australia, which earned me national recognition, and my success in a Global AI challenge where I won a [bronze medal](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6953778145170735105-joeF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) for accurately forecasting energy usage for a building in Malaysia, has led me to believe that it's my moral responsibility to contribute to society. I am now focused on educating the public about the critical importance of AI safety, a field that holds significant power in shaping the future of humanity.

Thank you for joining me on this adventure, and I look forward to sharing my thoughts and experiences.
